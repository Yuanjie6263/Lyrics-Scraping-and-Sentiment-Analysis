# Lyrics-Scraping-and-Sentiment-Analysis

The data source of this project is the website: https://www.azlyrics.com/, which contains a large number of lyrics for songs by various artists.

The dataset currently only contains song titles and full lyrics for two albums by Taylor Swift and Ed Sheeran. With the function in the LySSA Notebook, you can also pull more song lyrics from the site.

This dataset can be used for lyric analysis, such as word frequency analysis, sentiment analysis, etc. So that you can see how the lyrics vary from one artist to another, from two different artists from the same era, or from one genre of music to another.
