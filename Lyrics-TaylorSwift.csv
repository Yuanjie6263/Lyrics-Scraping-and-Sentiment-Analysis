0,Tim McGraw,Taylor Swift,"He said the way my blue eyes shinedPut those Georgia stars to shame that nightI said, ""That's a lie""Just a boy in a Chevy truckThat had a tendency of gettin' stuckOn back roads at nightAnd I was right there beside him all summer longAnd then the time we woke up to find that summer goneBut when you think Tim McGrawI hope you think my favorite songThe one we danced to all night longThe moon like a spotlight on the lakeWhen you think happinessI hope you think that little black dressThink of my head on your chestAnd my old faded blue jeansWhen you think Tim McGrawI hope you think of meSeptember saw a month of tearsAnd thankin' God that you weren't hereTo see me like thatBut in a box beneath my bedIs a letter that you never readFrom three summers backIt's hard not to find it all a little bittersweetAnd lookin' back on all of that, it's nice to believeWhen you think Tim McGrawI hope you think my favorite songThe one we danced to all night longThe moon like a spotlight on the lakeWhen you think happinessI hope you think that little black dressThink of my head on your chestAnd my old faded blue jeansWhen you think Tim McGrawI hope you think of meAnd I'm back for the first time since thenI'm standin' on your streetAnd there's a letter left on your doorstepAnd the first thing that you'll read is:""When you think Tim McGrawI hope you think my favorite songSomeday you'll turn your radio onI hope it takes you back to that place""When you think happinessI hope you think that little black dressThink of my head on your chestAnd my old faded blue jeansWhen you think Tim McGrawI hope you think of meOh, think of meMmmmHe said the way my blue eyes shinedPut those Georgia stars to shame that nightI said, ""That's a lie"" "

2,Teardrops On My Guitar,Taylor Swift,"Drew looks at meI fake a smile so he won't seeThat I want and I'm needingEverything that we should beI'll bet she's beautiful, that girl he talks aboutAnd she's got everything that I have to live withoutDrew talks to meI laugh 'cause it's just so funnyThat I can't even seeAnyone when he's with meHe says he's so in love, he's finally got it rightI wonder if he knows he's all I think about at nightHe's the reason for the teardrops on my guitarThe only thing that keeps me wishing on a wishing starHe's the song in the car I keep singing.

10,Our Song,Taylor Swift,"I was riding shotgunWith my hair undoneIn the front seat of his carHe's got a one-hand feelOn the steering wheelThe other on my heartI look around, turn the radio downHe says, ""Baby, is something wrong?""I say, ""NothingI was just thinkingHow we don't have a song""And he says...Our song is the slamming screen doorSneakin' out late, tapping on your windowWhen we're on the phone and you talk real slow'Cause it's late and your mama don't knowOur song is the way you laughThe first date: ""Man, I didn't kiss her, and I should have.""And when I got home ... 'fore I said, ""Amen""Asking God if he could play it againI was walking upThe front porch stepsAfter everything that dayHad gone all wrongAnd been trampled onAnd lost and thrown awayGot to the hallway,Well, on my wayTo my lovin' bedI almost didn't noticeAll the rosesAnd the note that said...Our song is the slamming screen doorSneakin' out late, tapping on your windowWhen we're on the phone and you talk real slow'Cause it's late and your mama don't knowOur song is the way you laughThe first date: ""Man, I didn't kiss her, and I should have""And when I got home ... 'fore I said, ""Amen""Asking God if he could play it againI've heard every album, listened to the radioWaited for something to come alongThat was as good as our song...'Cause our song is the slamming screen doorSneakin' out late, tapping on his windowWhen we're on the phone and he talks real slow'Cause it's late and his mama don't knowOur song is the way he laughsThe first date: ""Man, I didn't kiss him, and I should have""And when I got home ...
