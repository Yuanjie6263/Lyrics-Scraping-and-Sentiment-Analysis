0,Open Your Ears,Ed Sheeran,"Canât get you off my mindLook at me and you will findTime after time it seemsIâll say what I donât meanIn your world we were the sameIn mine now youâre the one to blameYou canât remember my nameWeâre lost, itâs such a shameListen to meStop making me seeWhat Iâve been waiting forListen to meStop making me seeIâm strong yet proudIâm quiet yet loudAnd Iâm everythingYou want in meIâm small yet tallI have it allAnd Iâm everythingYou want me to beListen to meStop making me seeWhat Iâve been waiting forListen to meStop making me seeAnd I still feel likeI need you stillAnd I still feel likeIâm on some pillAnd I still feel likeI need you stillListen to meStop making me seeWhat Iâve been waiting forListen to meMaking me see "
1,Beyond The Pale,Ed Sheeran,"Just lay it all down on meItâs getting harder for me to breatheJust want to know if it will beJust want to know if it is meAnd you know Iâve learned from my mistakesAnd how much have I got to lose?You find my heart is hard to breakCanât keep playing the foolBreathe in, exhaleTo turn to move beyond the paleFlag up, set sailTo find whatâs there beyond the paleI feel like Iâve gone to the end of the worldWhat do I have to do?You know Iâve learned from my mistakesHow much have I got to lose?You find my heart hard to breakCanât keep playing the foolBreathe in, exhaleTo turn to move beyond the paleFlag up, set sailTo find whatâs there beyond the paleWhat can I doJust to let you knowThat youâre in my mind?To try and justifyThe way you liberate meEvery time "
2,In Memory,Ed Sheeran,I write this song in memory ofThe wayward smileThe boy we won't forgetThe soul you took away from usThe river flowsThe tears that we weptMissing youIs all that needs to be saidMore than blueThe words inside my headAnd I know that you're goneAnd I know that you're goneThe cheeky smileOf jokes and laughsThe memories of timesWe crossed the lineThe stepping stonesAcross my mindWashed awayWe all now feel so blindMissing youIs all that needs to be saidMore than blueThe words inside my headAnd I know that you're goneI know that you're goneI know that you're goneI know that you're goneGoodbye 
3,Insomniac's Lullaby,Ed Sheeran,"Iâm getting very edgyCos youâre trying to take this from meAnd itâs something that I wanted so badCos youâre the definitionOf someone who has to ruinThe best thing that I ever hadCos youâre a jealous girlAnd all I can say isItâs your fault but partially mineFor losing hopeFor not treating you rightBut that will disappear in timeAll I gotta do is pass you byNever say whatâs wrongWhenever I say why?Standing in the cornerShadowed by the lightTo you I seem much smallerBut I know it might be youHow much better could I doTo be myself, not someone else?Iâm losing sleepI live only for the weekIâve grown to ignore youCos when I seem to bore youYou pretend that youâre not interestedYour eyes start to twinkleYour smile starts to widenAnd I just seem to try and forgetBut you pay me no attentionEven though I doBut I donât care as long as youâre mineItâs happening every timeAll I gotta do is pass you byNever say whatâs wrongWhenever I say why?Standing in the cornerShadowed by the lightTo you I seem much smallerBut I know it might be youHow much better could I doTo be myself, not someone else?Iâm losing sleepI live only for the weekAnd Iâm falling harder now it seemsMy slip-ups haunt me in my dreamsAnd I canât sleep although I think I canItâs insomnia I think I haveBut who cares when Iâm not your man?Standing in the cornerShadowed by the lightTo you I seem much smallerBut I know it might be youHow much better could I doTo be myself, not someone else?Iâm losing sleepI live only for the week "
4,Quiet Ballad Of Ed,Ed Sheeran,In shadow there lies hopeCut tension with a knifeI find it hard to copeStop playing with my lifeYou analyze my fearsAnalyze my dreamsChoke on burning tearsThrough my silent screamsThings aren't what they seemTell a hundred craftsmen to work on meTell this army of angels to make me breatheOpen doors just to take away the keyI'll let you all see that I'm doing betterWatch me fallAs I stumble at your feetAlways losing in this gameYour lies cut me deepAnd you don't even know my nameWith your consistencyTo always watch me crawlAnd my durabilityNot affected at allStill things aren't what they seemTell a hundred craftsmen to work on meTell this army of angels to make me breatheOpen doors just to take away the keyI'll let you all see that I'm doing betterFeel the painOn my brainFeel the strainAs I start to decayFeel the strainEvery passing dayFeel the painAs I start to decayTell a hundred craftsmen to work on meTell this army of angels to make me breatheOpen doors just to take away the keyI'll let you all see that I'm doing better 
5,No Luck,Ed Sheeran,Iâm screaming out upon my faceFollowed footsteps catch my paceBroken windows fall in placeNow shattered lovers find their placeWeâd flirtAnd youâd treat me like dirtAll the pain and the hurtJust to make matters worseAnd I see you all over himIrresistible sinWhen can we be the same again?What can I do to be making you see?To come out clean?Youâre better off with meWeâre stuckTaking time and wasting mineNo luckRunning around and crashing downIn you I trust nevermoreLeaving you in sand and glassAll I ever felt for youWent up in a cloud of smokeHow I could I be such a foolTo ever think that we were close?And I see you all over himIrresistible sinWhen can we be the same again?What can I do to be making you see?To come out clean?Youâre better off with meWeâre stuckTaking time and wasting mineNo luckRunning around and crashing downIn you I trust nevermoreLeaving you in sand and glass 
6,Stevensong,Ed Sheeran,Stevie was a boyWho turned into a manHe never had no master planBut I knew that he couldFind right from wrongSing me a different songHe told me which road to takeAnd now Iâm goneKeep on singingMake her life wholeStevie youâre winningAnd I just feel coldTake your life beyond the markYou can do no wrongWhen I lose my way in the darkKeep singing your songPlease come follow meI find it hard to breathePlease come follow meI find it hard to breathe 
7,Billy Ruskin,Ed Sheeran,"Mr Ruskin come and paint my pictureWeâre losing sleep 'cos we steal the weekNow whoâs your best friend?Can you introduce me?See I canât seem to even let you breatheWhen I dance with Billy Ruskin in my mindâs eyePlease let me forget that Iâm standing on my ownAnd I am my own best friend and I need me to seeThat I am more than what is hiding in meCome and show me if you canSee I know youâre meBut I canât seem to understandIf you know me, place my hand on mineAnd we will resurrect the timeThat we lost when you left my mindItâs psycho-paranoia disappearing in timeCome and show me what makes you tickI need you to get out of my mind quickWhen I dance with Billy Ruskin in my mindâs eyePlease let me forget that Iâm standing on my ownAnd I am my own best friend and I need me to seeThat I am more than what is hiding in me "
8,Spark,Ed Sheeran,Take me with you I do declareI love you dearly through here and thereWhat can I do to make you share?What can I do to make you care?The world is harshIâm stuck in the darkIâll make my markIâve got my sparkWeâd be together through bad or worseSending letters we shall converseWe could do better but we must firstMake amendsThat dependsWill you be my friend?The world is harshIâm stuck in the darkIâll make my markIâve got my spark 
9,Pause,Ed Sheeran,"You know I got to get awayTo find some peace and sanityIâve been playing hide-and-seek too longShaking, making, everybody wakingSetting the hi-fi bleedKeeping me backWhile youâre spinning my trackThatâll knock you off your feetMonkey see what monkey doBut Iâm a monkey telling youI just think that we should take a breakTickity-tock the clockWith the hip-hopAnd alonestar backing me upWe wonât stopI gotta be searching for my peace of mindNow let the track rewindAnd play, let the music playIt came, so let the music say what it feelsShame, shame it took too longTo see that you were wrongNow turn the song back onThis is Alonestar coming at youWith a new styleKicking dustReady to bustIt's Urban AngelArtistic, flipping the scriptWho d'you really want to get it with?Ed and AlonestarWe're like live wires sparkingReady to blowWe've already sown our seedsWe're just waiting to grow - blowWe're gonna lift you like a shock to your bodyMetaphorical speech when we come and seeYou ducking for coverSheeran Lock coming ready to rockWith Urban Angel and AlonestarAnd Ed - keep it lockedLet the beat pumpDrop the bass but don't stopWe're kicking the soundLet the bass bins poundWe're gonna rollCan you feel me now with my body?Get down to the soundIt's Ed Sheeran in the placeAnd Alonestar rising upWe gotta rise upI said rise upAnd play, let the music playIt came, so let the music say what it feelsShame, shame it took so longTo see that you were wrongNow turn the song back on "
10,The Sea,Ed Sheeran,"Pass me a drinkYou say itâs gonna take a whileYour consciousness sinksTears from a crocodileYouâre wasting your timeGiving me the speechYou try to, donât reachYour smileYouâre holding your tearsYour inside is deadYouâre eating your fearsIn a cigaretteYouâve waited too longTo finally seeThe sunshine in the rainIs as deep as the seaIâve taken the blowItâs all down on paperHad fun in the snowBut no âsee you laterâYouâre wasting your timeGiving me the speechYou try to, donât reachYour smileYouâre holding your tearsYour inside is deadYouâre eating your fearsIn a cigaretteYouâve waited too longTo finally seeThe sunshine in the rainIs as deep as the sea "
11,Way Home,Ed Sheeran,"Well I once heard a story about a run-down homeWhere a man and his thoughts lived all aloneHe tried to live, no effort was shownHeâs slowly finding a way back homeHe had a family with smiles and frownsThey never could solve his way to be downCos heâs one dog who donât want a boneHeâs slowly finding a way back homeHe had a nice house with windows and doorsHe said to his wife whatâs mine is yoursBut the seeds of deception are soon to be sownHeâs slowly finding a way back homeHis children have left but the rooms are still thereHis misses the noise and the scents in their hairBut far from the nest the babies have flownHeâs slowly finding a way back homeHis wife was an angel sent from aboveHe never returned her kisses or loveBut soon heâd found that sheâd overgrownThis man whoâs finding a way back homeSo the leaves are all dead in this broken manâs JuneThe rain will still fall on the sunny afternoonHe stares at the floor, no more to roamHeâs slowly finding a way back homeWell I once heard a story about a run-down homeWhere a man with regrets lived all aloneHe tried to live, no effort was shownHeâll never find a way back home "
12,Bonus Track,Ed Sheeran,"I want to be realNot some conscience to myselfThe way you worship, never endingSome idol whoâs pretending to be trueHow you put upon yourselfA man who never seemsTo answer to you wordsSo go and make me overIâm a fly upon your neckYou canât control meI have my words, my voiceMy strengths, my choiceAnd I can cut as deepJust as deep as I needDonât want your adviceCos Iâve made up my own mindThe way you bore me with the storiesOf far and distant timesIâve heard it beforeSo donât try that on meThe way you worship, never-endingSome idol whoâs pretending to be trueIt could be youBrainwashed by the liesItâs no surpriseThat youâd wanna waste your timeIâm a fly upon your neckYou canât control meI have my words, my voiceMy strengths, my choiceAnd I can cut as deepJust as deep as I need "
